<!-- 
- when the browser goes in and interprets the html, an object is build and I have access to it through the JS console by typing document. 
- go to JS console and type console.log(document); everything in blue is the document, look through #document and see what's there
-->

<!--
- document is an object that is only available on JS running on a web browser
- in the console type document.body   document is the object and body is the key on that object, the information returned in the console is the value of the object
-->

<!--
- now that I have access to the DOM itself. the DOM has the ability to select elements from inside of itself
- in the console type document.body.children
- I can traverser through the DOM and select items that I want
-->
