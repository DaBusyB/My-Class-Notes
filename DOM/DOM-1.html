 <!-- DOM - document object model
- when a browser loads a webpage it downloads the HTML, then it parse through the HTML file and create a JS object out of the HTML
- the HTML is my instructions to the browser on how built the website
- the browser takes the instucitons, decodes them, and codes them into JS and builds an object out of it
- the browser displays JS, not HTML, it reads HTML and makes JS out of it
 the browser used the DOM to display what is in the page

<!-- How to include JS in my site -->

<html>
    <head>
        <script> /* inserting script elemet will tell the browser that this element is JS  I can write JS into this script from the console */
         console.log('Hiya there.'); /* open this in google console */
         alert('hi');
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
</html>

<!-- it is bad pratice to write JS into the script like above -->
<!-- we should import an external JS file into our HTML file see DOM-2 file-->
