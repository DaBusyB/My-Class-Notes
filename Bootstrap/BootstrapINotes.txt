*Library vs Framework  

- a library or framework - a codebase created by someone and it will make my life easier library is more targeted 

- a library - more general, can be small
- framework - more broad and can change the way I use the language all together
            - changes the way you use the language


*When to use frameworks or libraries? 

ask myself...

1) Is the library or framework well established and supported?
2) What is the ramp up time? learning time?
3) Does this actually solve the problem I want it to solve?


*How to use Bootstrap

My code needs to be able to link to the bootstrap codebase

-when traversing code bases, ask myself

    - what library or framework am I using and how are they connected?
    - is it hiding in my code base or am I linking to it online?

1) by pasting CSS link in header - the link is in the docs
              and JS scripts - before closing body tag in html file

              - good for playing around or small projects



2) download the bootstrap codebase into my file structure

-bootstrap has a css and js folder with lots of other foles within them
the main folders I need are bootstrap.css adn bootstrap.js

- bootstrap - is a grid system
            - mobile friendly
            - abstracts things out to html

- grid system - container
              - inside container are rows
              - inside rows are columns

- when thinking of my layout think in container, row, column format
